# Bondibar
Sendero's LED strip driver PCB

Sendero is a lighting system designed for artistic production (https://github.com/LaboratorioDeMedios/Sendero).

In this repository you will find the Eagle files for building the Bondibar PCB.

The Bondibar is a LED Strip driver using WS2801.

The Bondibar uses standard USB cables to daisychain data transmission, IRF520 high power transistors to power up up to 8 LED strips per PCB, and it can also daisychain power from one Bondibar to another.

The Bondibar was designed by Pablo Gindel (http://www.pablogindel.com) in 2013-2014.
